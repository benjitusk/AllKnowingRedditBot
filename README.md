# AllKnowingRedditBot
## Q: What is this?
A: These are the digital innards of u/AllKnowingRedditBot, your friendly neighborhood reddit all-in-one bot.
## Q: Nice... um... What can your Reddit bot do?

A: Yup, you have no idea what you just walked into...

Table Key:
* \<argument\> means that you must include this information. If you don't, the command will fail.
* [argument] means that you don't have to put any information there, but it might help if you do
* [some_symbol_here \<argument\>] means that you don't have to include anything there, but if you do, you *must* format it as such.
    * For example, if the symbol is `#`, then you gotta put the argument _after_ the `#`. This is used when a space is not enough to separate arguments from each other, like when searching the lyrics to a song, because the title of a song can have spaces in it.
